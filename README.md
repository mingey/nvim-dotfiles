# Strictly personal Neovim config

By all means steal ideas from this; I probably stole them myself in the first place.

But keep in mind that this is the config of a non-programmer; I've just in the last
week or two converted it over to Lua from VimScript; and I still only half-understand
the whole thing. It gives plenty of error messages still (non-fatal...so far), and I
couldn't tell you why what does work, works.

In other words, feel free to use this, but understand that it's no kind of model
for a correct (or even fully working) configuration. Caveat Vim(tu)tor!
